# Battle-Game, The Battle game designed with python for/while loop statements.

I developed a battle game with python.

Task 1: I declared variables for game character wizard, elf, human, dragon and variables to store each character's hitpoints and damage received.

Task 2: I have an "Input" code that accepts inputs 1,2, or 3 from player to choose a character fro battle.

Task 3: The goal was to surrpound my code in task 2 with an infinite "while loop". The code breaks out of the while loop when a valid choice(1,2,3) is made and the character statistics are displayed. The code returns "Unknown character" when a chosen character is out of the given range.

Task 4: Here, the Dragon battle time begins. IN the end, whoever causes other to fall to 0 or below hitpoint first wins. I implemented a second infinite while loop calculate the damage received per character chosen and breaks when the dragon hitpoint drops to zero or negative(dragon_hp <= 0). The same is applied when the character hit points drops to zero or negative(my_hp <= 0).
